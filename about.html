            <div class="row">
                <p class = "fs-3 px-5"> We at Ration have identified a problem with food waste, specifically, household food waste. 
                    It is a common experience to go grocery shopping, and to end up discarding half of the food purchased by the end of the week. 
                    In fact, this is so common, that about <strong> 80 million pounds </strong> of food are wasted each year. 
                </p>  

                <p class="fs-3 px-5">
                    Because of this, we decided to create a website that guides users in food waste prevention. 
                    There are similar apps on the market like <span class="fw-bolder fst-italic"> TooGoodToGo, Flashfood </span> and <span class="fw-bolder fst-italic"> FoodForAll </span> 
                    However, these sites focus on restaurant and grocery food waste,
                    while we specialize in <strong> household food waste. </strong>

                    This was because the food we bought went bad quicker before we could eat it, like fresh produce.

                        and some of the world’s greatest issues - climate change, world hunger, waste management - were inextricably tied to food waste.
